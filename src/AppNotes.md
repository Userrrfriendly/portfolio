## TODO:
    - all images must be the same size
    - Should <Project/> consume each property at a time (main.js) or should it swallow the object and deconstruct it inside the render of project.js?
    - move the propTypes from project into the class as a static method.
    - <Story/> make the figure a div or a section?
    - figurecaption must be moved accordingly to the screen size/media queries
    - .project-caption must be styled green for freeCodeCamp and blue for Udacity
    - try flexbox for aligning the images in the stories
    - https://css-tricks.com/creating-svg-icon-system-react/
    - main -> my bio <h2> must be moved in the acording section
    - Stories and Projects should be list items
        - Add tab index to the stories and the projects (if all things are wrapped in links it will be taken care of)
