## Remember:
    - all images must be the same size
    - Should <Project/> consume each property at a time (main.js) or should it swallow the object and deconstruct it inside the render of project.js?
    - move the propTypes from project into the class as a static method.
    - try flexbox for aligning the images in the stories
