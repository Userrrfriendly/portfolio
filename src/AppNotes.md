* You have CSS rules for article both in projec.css & story.css... Can this be done better?
* At the footer add a 'to the top' button
* Add a mobile navigation button
* 


* data.js holds the values that create the stories
* the figure has a initial width/height of 140% and on hover it shirnks to 100% 
* try implementing img or picture that can serve different images based on the device rather than the background-image prop.
