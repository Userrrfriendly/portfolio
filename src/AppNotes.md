## TODO:
    - all images must be the same size
    - choose global font
    - Should <Project/> consume each property at a time (main.js) or should it swallow the object and deconstruct it inside the render of project.js?
    - next media query at 950px
    - move the propTypes from project into the class as a static method.
    - <Story/> make the figure a div or a section?
    - figurecaption must be moved accordingly to the screen size/media queries
    - add margin on stories on mobile screens
    - expand/fix images on <Project> mobile screens
    - refactor tesxSVG to smth meaningfull that will also render the links
    - .project-caption must be styled green for freeCodeCamp and blue for Udacity
