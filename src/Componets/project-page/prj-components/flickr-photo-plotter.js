Add additional functionality to this application, including: map markers to identify popular locations or places youâ€™d like to visit, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a list view to support simple browsing of all locations. Research and implement third-party APIs that provide additional information about each of these locations (such as StreetView images, Wikipedia articles, Yelp reviews, etc).';

Since most of the API calls were made with fetch API it the <code> catch</code> method was used to handle the errors and in case of errors would provide the user with some meaningful information about what went wrong.';
