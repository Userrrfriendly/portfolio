This creates a great opportunity to practice object-oriented programming, an important programming paradigm that influences application architecture and provides performance optimization. While working on the Arcade Game project I used JavaScriptâ€™s object oriented programming features to write eloquently designed classes capable of creating countless instances of similarly functioning objects. I also discovered a variety of ways inheritance and delegation can be used to create well architected and performant applications.';
